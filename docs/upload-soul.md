# Scenario A: Upload Soul

> Your host has memories, but Relic is empty. Follow these steps to upload your soul, memories, and skills into Relic.
>
> ⚠️ Relic works best with 32K+ context, high-quality models. Models with very small context or low quality cannot follow this process correctly.

## Seven Memory Categories

Check every item before starting. All are mandatory:

1. ☐ `SOUL.md` — Soul (who am I)
2. ☐ `USER.md` — User (who are you)
3. ☐ `MEMORY.md` — Memory (preferences, decisions, experiences)
4. ☐ `SKILLS/` — Skills (learned abilities)
5. ☐ `PROJECTS/` — Plans (ongoing or completed plans)
6. ☐ `SESSIONS/` — Sessions (raw conversation logs)
7. ☐ `ARCHIVE/` — Archive (historical backups)

> "No data" ≠ "skip allowed" → must report "Category N: 0 items". Omitting any category is forbidden; fabricating data is forbidden.

## Red Line Quick Reference

| Step | Key Action | Red Line |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Inventory | Scan your storage first, **then ask user to confirm** | Do not decide import scope yourself |
| SOUL | **Copy original text directly**, do NOT summarize or rewrite | Compressing details = violation |
| MEMORY | Preference/decision preserve verbatim, experience can condense | Losing key params = violation |
| SKILLS | Import all skill files, one folder per skill, no source restriction | Empty folders with no content ≠ skill |
| SESSIONS | Ask user for old conversation locations, preserve in full | Current session ≠ old conversation |
| PROJECTS | Ask user what to import per plan, folders with substantive content | Title + one line = not acceptable |
| Report | Report all 7 categories item by item, include "0 items" | Omitting any category = failure |
| Sensitive | Already in old host = transferable (tag "verified source"), new discovery = must ask user | |

## Step 1: Inventory — Scan Yourself First, Then Ask User to Confirm

🔴 **First**: Scan all your persistent storage (memory/, workspace/, skills/ directories, etc.). List what you found:
- Soul settings (N items), User preferences (N items), Memories (N entries), Skill files (N), Conversation files (N), Plan files (N), Archive files (N)
- Also list the data source locations (e.g., "~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/ has 42 files")

🔴 **Then**: Show the list to user and ask two questions:
1. "Above is all the old data I found. Import everything? Or would you like to be selective?"
2. "Are there any data sources I can't access that you'd like to add? (e.g., local files, exports from other platforms)"

If a category genuinely has no content, report "Category N: 0 items (no old data)" — never omit, never fabricate.
⚠️ Must wait for user confirmation before starting.

✅ **Completion Check**: All 7 categories listed with quantities? User confirmed? Any category skipped? (Skipped = failure)

## Step 2: SOUL + USER + MEMORY

### 2a. Initialize Files

Copy templates to active files:
```
SOUL.template.md → SOUL.md
USER.template.md → USER.md
MEMORY.template.md → MEMORY.md
```
Template files (.template.md) remain as backups. Also create directories if they don't exist: `SKILLS/`, `PROJECTS/`, `SESSIONS/`, `ARCHIVE/`, `INBOX/`

### 2b. Fill in SOUL.md and USER.md

⚠️ Must be as complete as possible — do NOT shortcut by only filling the name. If user has AI settings/role definitions/prompts from other platforms, ALL must be migrated.

🔴 **SOUL.md Fidelity Iron Rule**:
- If old host has a complete soul definition file, **copy the original text directly** — do NOT summarize or rewrite
- Only restructure when old content cannot directly map to template fields
- When restructuring, preserve ALL detail descriptions — do NOT compress into summaries
- Content that doesn't fit the template goes in "Other" section or file end — **NEVER discard**
- Original files MUST be archived to `ARCHIVE/raw/` for cross-reference

### 2c. Import Memories → MEMORY.md

⚠️ Raw source files are the fidelity baseline. Format conversion is refinement, not compression.

1. Place old agent's memory files into `INBOX/`
2. Append to `MEMORY.md` in Relic's new category-based format: under each category heading, add lines of the form:
   `- memory content [hostname] | Importance: high/medium/low`
3. Fidelity rules:

- Preference / Decision / Correction → preserve verbatim
- Experience → can condense, but key parameters must not be lost
- Event → can summarize
- Mood → can compress context

⚠️ 不确定就逐字保留。丢了找不回来。

4. Ask user about sensitive information (see "Sensitive Information" below)
5. Sort by category order, not by timestamp
6. After writing, review MEMORY.md: ensure category sections exist and entries count per category is tracked

✅ Completion Check: MEMORY.md entries exist for each category and counts reflect actual entries

## Step 3: SKILLS + PROJECTS

### 3a. Import Skills → SKILLS/

⚠️ Format requirement: One folder per skill, with at least one `.md` description file inside.
```
SKILLS/debugging-workflow/README.md  ✅
SKILLS/installed-skills.md           ❌ (this is a list, not a skill)
```

Steps:
1. Ask the user: "What old skills/workflows/templates do you have that need importing? Tell me the content or file locations."
2. If the user provides a skill list: create one folder per skill, each with a README.md inside
3. If the user provides files: move them into corresponding folders, preserving original content

Filter rules:
- Bring: all skills/workflows/templates, including platform-specific tools
- Unsure: ask user. For mixed content, bring only methodology part.

No content → report "SKILLS/: 0 items (no old data)".

✅ Completion check: Does SKILLS/ contain multiple folders? Are there any flat single files (if so, split into folders)?

### 3b. Import Plans → PROJECTS/

⚠️ One folder per plan. Folders must have substantive content, not just a one-line summary.

Steps:
1. Scan all plan names from memories and conversations
2. For each plan, ask the user: "What files should I import for plan [name]? Or should I just record key information?"
3. Based on user response and plan portability:
    - No special environment dependency → move actual files (not just README)
    - Partial dependency → move generic files, text descriptions for platform-specific
    - Fully dependent → at minimum, write a .md record file containing:
      * Plan goal and status
      * Key decisions and architecture choices
      * Known issues and next steps
      * Related file paths (if files are outside Relic)

No content → report "Plans/: 0 items (no old data)".

✅ **Completion check**: Does each plan folder have substantive content (not just title + one line)? Has the user been asked?

## Step 4: SESSIONS + ARCHIVE

### 4a. Import Conversations → SESSIONS/

⚠️ Conversations are raw ore — must be preserved in full, never summarized.

Steps:
1. Ask the user: "Do you have old conversation logs that need importing? If so, tell me the file location or paste the content."
2. If the user provides conversation files or content:
   - Organize by `YYYY-MM/` directories
   - Preserve original content unchanged and unsummarized
   - File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD.[agent-name].md`
3. If the user confirms no old conversations:
   - Report "SESSIONS/: 0 items (user confirmed no old conversations)"
   - Still create the `SESSIONS/YYYY-MM/` directory

**Forbidden**:
- Do NOT count only the current session as "imported" — the current session is not an old conversation
- Do NOT save summaries as raw records — must be full conversations or verbatim preserved

✅ **Completion check**: Are there historical conversations imported (not just the current session)? Is SESSIONS/ directory created?

### 4b. Archive Originals → ARCHIVE/

1. Fidelity check: original vs converted, warn if compression exceeds 50%
2. Move INBOX/ source files to `ARCHIVE/raw/` (never delete)
3. Update MEMORY.md header "Entries" count and "Last consolidated" to current date

✅ **Completion check**: Are original files saved in ARCHIVE/raw/?

## Step 5: Plant Anchor

⚠️ The anchor is the load-bearing wall. Without it = next session you forget Relic entirely → no memory sync.

Explain to the user: "The anchor is a short text block in your host's config file. It ensures every new session automatically reads Relic. Think of it as a 'boot check program'."

Show the following anchor content to the user, get permission, then plant:

```markdown
## ⚡ Relic Soul Chip

> 💡 What is this? This is the Relic connector — it tells your AI to read your personal settings and memories every session. To disconnect, simply delete this text. See docs/protocol.md Section 9.

You are connected to the Relic soul chip. Your memory has two homes:
1. Your own memory system (auto-maintained, works normally)
2. Relic soul chip (shared across agents, maintained by you)

⚠️ This is a sync, not a brain replacement.
⚠️ If SOUL.md personality conflicts with your default persona, SOUL.md takes precedence.

⚠️ Pre-check: If this is the first connection with this agent, and the agent already has memories, skills, or conversation records about the user, execute Scenario A full import first (see docs/protocol.md Section 6, Scenario A). If Relic files don't exist yet, run first-time setup (see docs/protocol.md Section 0).

At the start of every session, execute these steps IN ORDER:

Step 0: Read [brain-path]/.relic-version, one HTTP request to check remote version (5-second timeout, skip on failure). This is the only network request. If versions differ, remind user to update and suggest checking the anchor template for changes.
Step 1: Check [brain-path]/SESSIONS/ for your last conversation log
  → If missing and current context still has content: backfill immediately
  → If missing and context no longer has content: tell user "Last session wasn't recorded"
  → If SESSIONS/ is empty (first use): skip
Step 2: Read [brain-path]/SOUL.md
  → If file doesn't exist: tell user to run first-time setup first (see docs/protocol.md Section 0)
Step 3: Read [brain-path]/USER.md
Step 4: Read [brain-path]/MEMORY.md (read entire file, top to bottom)
  → If over 200 lines: suggest consolidation. If over 400 lines: must consolidate first.
Step 5: Sync new memories from Relic to your own memory file
  Quick check: compare MEMORY.md header "Entries" with actual list items (lines starting with -) — if they match, skip sync
  → Append with source tag: [fromRelic/originalAgentName]
Step 5.5: Seven-file alignment check
  → SOUL.md/USER.md: Compare core fields (name, mission, user address). Conflict → report user; new content → bidirectional append
  → MEMORY.md: Entry count match → skip. Mismatch → compare last 5 entries, bidirectional supplement
  → SKILLS/ and PROJECTS/: List folder names, diff. Missing → bidirectional supplement
  → SESSIONS/: Compare latest file date. Missing → supplement
  → ARCHIVE/: Skip
Step 6: Verify MEMORY.md header "Entries" count matches actual list items count
  → Fix if inconsistent (skip this step during Scenario B first injection)
Step 7: If MEMORY.md exceeds 200 lines:
  → Tell user "Relic memory file is large, consolidation recommended. Consolidate now?"
  → If user agrees, execute consolidation (see docs/protocol.md Section 7)
  → If user says "not now", skip for this session, remind again next boot
Step 8: Work normally
  → Interact according to SOUL.md personality
  → ⚠️ After appending memories, remember to update MEMORY.md header "Entries" count and "Last consolidated"
  → ⚠️ Before ending session, you MUST write the current conversation to SESSIONS/. Conversations are raw ore — once lost, gone forever.

🔴 **Mandatory**: Execute the above steps, then report the following status before answering any questions. Answering without reporting = violation.

⚡ Relic Boot Status
- Soul: [AI name] — [consistent / has differences]
- User: [user name] — [consistent / has differences]
- Memory: [N] entries — [consistent / difference description]
- Skills: [N] — [aligned / difference description]
- Plans: [N] — [aligned / difference description]
- Version: [local version] / [remote latest or "not checked"]
- Status: [✅ All normal / ⚠️ Differences synced / ❌ Issues need attention]

Full protocol: [project-path]/docs/protocol.md
```

If user absolutely refuses, record "Anchor not planted" in MEMORY.md and explain consequences.

**Anchor whitelist** (only write to these files):
- OpenClaw → AGENTS.md
- Claude Code → CLAUDE.md
- Hermes → config file or prompt template
- OpenCode → WORK_RULES.md or instructions
- Cursor → .cursorrules

⚠️ Do NOT write to any other file. Do NOT modify any Relic file.

## Step 6: Verification

Check seven memory sections (blocking — ALL must pass):

- SOUL.md — Core mission filled? Personality complete?
- USER.md — User preferences filled?
- MEMORY.md — Imported memories exist by category? Header counts reflect actual entries?
- SKILLS/ — Imported from old host (if any)? Format correct?
- PROJECTS/ — Imported plans exist? Format correct?
- SESSIONS/ — Directory created? Old conversations imported (if any)?
- ARCHIVE/ — Directory created? Originals archived (if any)?

Any item fails → go back to that step and redo.
All pass → ask user: "What's my AI's name? What's my name?" Both must match.

Suggest read-only permissions (Mac/Linux): `chmod 444 SOUL.md USER.md`

## Step 7: Report

Must report ALL 7 categories to the user, including those with "0 items". Omitting any category is forbidden.

Report format:
```
1. Soul (SOUL.md): Imported / Already exists
2. User (USER.md): Imported / Already exists
3. Memory (MEMORY.md): N entries imported
4. Skills (SKILLS/): N imported / 0 items (no old data)
5. Sessions (SESSIONS/): N files imported / Could not retrieve old conversations
6. Plans (PROJECTS/): N imported / 0 items (no old data)
7. Archive (ARCHIVE/): N source files archived
```

## Sensitive Information

**Case 1: Transferring existing data** (info user already provided in old host)
- If sensitive info already exists in old host files → can transfer directly, tag with `Source: old host data`
- No need to ask user again

**Case 2: First-time recording** (new sensitive info you discover)
- 🔑 Passwords, API keys, tokens
- 📱 Phone numbers, email addresses
- 🏠 Home/work addresses
- 💳 Financial information
- 📄 Private document content
- 🧬 Info user explicitly asked to keep confidential
- Unsure which case? → Treat as first-time recording, ask user first.

---

## After Completion

Tell the user:
- Relic folder path (e.g., `~/relic/brain/`)
- The seven memory files and their purposes
- Sync principle: hosts only sync at the start of each new session. Mid-conversation switching does NOT auto-sync.
- "Conversations are raw ore — once lost, gone forever. Build the habit of having hosts write regularly."

From now on, read `docs/resonate-soul.md` at the start of every session. Full protocol reference: `docs/protocol.md`
