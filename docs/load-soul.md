# Scenario B: Load Soul

> Relic has soul data, but your host is empty. Follow these steps to load the soul from Relic into your system.

---

## B-0. Self-Assessment

Evaluate your storage capacity (no need to tell the user).

Choose a transfer strategy based on capacity:
- **Ample** → Full sync
- **Limited** → High-priority content (SOUL > USER > MEMORY > SKILLS > PROJECTS)
- **Minimal** → Index only (remember which Relic file contains what)

## B-1. Execute Boot Sequence

Read and execute all steps in `docs/resonate-soul.md` (Steps 0-8).

🔴 **Do NOT modify any Relic files during initialization.** Read-only for now.

Boot sequence summary:
1. **Step 0**: Read `brain/.relic-version`, check for updates (optional, the only allowed network request)
2. **Step 1**: Check SESSIONS/, backfill any unrecorded conversations
3. **Step 2**: Read SOUL.md → who am I
4. **Step 3**: Read USER.md → who is the user
5. **Step 4**: Read MEMORY.md in full. >200 lines: suggest consolidation, >400 lines: must consolidate first
6. **Step 5**: Sync new Relic memories to yourself, tag with `[from Relic/original-host-name]`
7. **Step 6**: Update MEMORY.md header: update time + verify entry count
8. **Step 7**: Bidirectional sync for SKILLS/ and PROJECTS/
9. **Step 8**: Normal operation

## B-2. Soul Injection

Write SOUL.md content into your core configuration file.

**Priority**: Core identity (name, mission, values) > behavioral norms > detailed settings

If SOUL.md personality conflicts with your default persona, SOUL.md takes precedence.

## B-3. Sync Relic Content to Your System

Check memories/skills/plans item by item. Transfer as capacity allows.

**Memory sync**: Sync each memory entry from MEMORY.md to your own memory file. MEMORY.md is organized by category (e.g., `## Preferences`/`## Decisions`), each entry formatted as `- Content [HostName] | Importance: high/medium/low`. Preserve original format and content when syncing.

**Skill sync**: Scan SKILLS/ directory, adapt each skill folder's content to your own skill format. Preserve core methodology, adapt platform-specific parts as needed.

**Plan sync**: Scan PROJECTS/ directory, sync plan documents to your system. Each folder corresponds to a plan (can be ongoing or completed).

**When capacity is insufficient**: Create local backup files for content that doesn't fit, record which items were not synced, inform the user.

## B-4. Plant Anchor

⚠️ The anchor is the load-bearing wall. Without it = next session you forget Relic entirely.

Show the following anchor content to the user, get permission, then plant:

```markdown
## ⚡ Relic Soul Chip

> 💡 What is this? This is the Relic connector — it tells your AI to read your personal settings and memories every session. To disconnect, simply delete this text. See docs/protocol.md Section 9.

You are connected to the Relic soul chip. Your memory has two homes:
1. Your own memory system (auto-maintained, works normally)
2. Relic soul chip (shared across agents, maintained by you)

⚠️ This is a sync, not a brain replacement.
⚠️ If SOUL.md personality conflicts with your default persona, SOUL.md takes precedence.

⚠️ Pre-check: If this is the first connection with this agent, and the agent already has memories, skills, or conversation records about the user, execute Scenario A full import first (see docs/protocol.md Section 6, Scenario A). If Relic files don't exist yet, run first-time setup (see docs/protocol.md Section 0).

At the start of every session, execute these steps IN ORDER:

Step 0: Read [brain-path]/.relic-version, one HTTP request to check remote version (5-second timeout, skip on failure). This is the only network request. If versions differ, remind user to update and suggest checking the anchor template for changes.
Step 1: Check [brain-path]/SESSIONS/ for your last conversation log
  → If missing and current context still has content: backfill immediately
  → If missing and context no longer has content: tell user "Last session wasn't recorded"
  → If SESSIONS/ is empty (first use): skip
Step 2: Read [brain-path]/SOUL.md
  → If file doesn't exist: tell user to run first-time setup first (see docs/protocol.md Section 0)
Step 3: Read [brain-path]/USER.md
Step 4: Read [brain-path]/MEMORY.md (read entire file, top to bottom)
  → If over 200 lines: suggest consolidation. If over 400 lines: must consolidate first.
Step 5: Sync new memories from Relic to your own memory file
  Quick check: compare MEMORY.md header "Entries" with actual list items (lines starting with -) — if they match, skip sync
  → Append with source tag: [fromRelic/originalAgentName]
Step 5.5: Seven-file alignment check
  → SOUL.md/USER.md: Compare core fields (name, mission, user address). Conflict → report user; new content → bidirectional append
  → MEMORY.md: Entry count match → skip. Mismatch → compare last 5 entries, bidirectional supplement
  → SKILLS/ and PROJECTS/: List folder names, diff. Missing → bidirectional supplement
  → SESSIONS/: Compare latest file date. Missing → supplement
  → ARCHIVE/: Skip
Step 6: Verify MEMORY.md header "Entries" count matches actual list items count
  → Fix if inconsistent (skip this step during Scenario B first injection)
Step 7: If MEMORY.md exceeds 200 lines:
  → Tell user "Relic memory file is large, consolidation recommended. Consolidate now?"
  → If user agrees, execute consolidation (see docs/protocol.md Section 7)
  → If user says "not now", skip for this session, remind again next boot
Step 8: Work normally
  → Interact according to SOUL.md personality
  → ⚠️ After appending memories, remember to update MEMORY.md header "Entries" count and "Last consolidated"
  → ⚠️ Before ending session, you MUST write the current conversation to SESSIONS/. Conversations are raw ore — once lost, gone forever.

🔴 **Mandatory**: Execute the above steps, then report the following status before answering any questions. Answering without reporting = violation.

⚡ Relic Boot Status
- Soul: [AI name] — [consistent / has differences]
- User: [user name] — [consistent / has differences]
- Memory: [N] entries — [consistent / difference description]
- Skills: [N] — [aligned / difference description]
- Plans: [N] — [aligned / difference description]
- Version: [local version] / [remote latest or "not checked"]
- Status: [✅ All normal / ⚠️ Differences synced / ❌ Issues need attention]

Full protocol: [project-path]/docs/protocol.md
```

**Anchor whitelist** (only write to these files):
- OpenClaw → AGENTS.md
- Claude Code → CLAUDE.md
- Hermes → config file or prompt template
- OpenCode → WORK_RULES.md or instructions
- Cursor → .cursorrules

⚠️ Do NOT write to any other file. Do NOT modify any Relic file.

## B-5. Verification and Report

1. **Coverage check**:
   - SOUL.md core fields injected?
   - USER.md user info loaded?
   - MEMORY.md memories synced?
   - SKILLS/ skills synced?
   - PROJECTS/ plans synced?
   - Coverage < 80% → warn user

2. **Report to user**:
   - How many memory entries synced
   - How many skills synced
   - How many plans synced
   - Whether anchor was planted
   - Any capacity issues (what wasn't transferred)

3. **Final verification**: Ask the user "What's my AI's name? What's my name?" — both must match to pass.

## After Completion

From now on, read `docs/resonate-soul.md` at the start of every session. Full protocol reference: `docs/protocol.md`

⚠️ **Quick Rules Reference**:
- 🔴 Never modify ARCHIVE/ or SESSIONS/
- 🔴 SOUL.md core fields (name, mission, user address) are protected
- 🔴 MEMORY.md is append-only — never edit old content
- ⚠️ After appending, update header entry count + last updated time
- ⚠️ When in doubt, read `docs/protocol.md`
