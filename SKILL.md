# ⚡ Relic Soul Chip

Give your AI agent a persistent personality and memory that survives sessions and follows the user across different agents. Pure Markdown. Human-readable.

**Switch agents. Keep the soul.**

## When to Trigger

- User mentions wanting persistent AI personality or memory
- User says "set up Relic" or "I want my AI to remember me"
- User switches agents and wants continuity
- Boot sequence (every session if Relic is set up)

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | Optional |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| `git` | Clone/update the Relic repo | Yes (can manually download) |
| HTTP request | Version check (raw.githubusercontent.com, once per session) | Yes (skip if offline) |
| Filesystem read | Read SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md | No |
| Filesystem write | Append to MEMORY.md, write session logs | No |
| Agent config modify | Plant "neural anchor" for auto-loading | Yes (user can skip) |

All file operations are confined to `~/relic/brain/` (or user-specified directory). The only access outside this directory is the optional one-time neural anchor in agent config. Network access is limited to version check and optional git pull — no data upload, no third-party services.

## Steps

### First-time Setup

1. Install Relic: `git clone https://github.com/LucioLiu/relic.git ~/relic`
2. Read the full protocol: `~/relic/brain/PROTOCOL.md`
3. Copy templates to active files (SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md)
4. Help user fill in SOUL.md (AI name + core mission) and USER.md (user preferences)
5. **Neural anchor (optional):** Ask user if they want to add a startup reference to their agent config. If yes, show exactly what will be appended, get confirmation, then append. Do not modify existing config content.
6. Verify: ask "What's my AI's name? What's my name?" — both must be correct

### Every Session (Boot Sequence)

1. **Version check** (once per session): Read `~/relic/brain/.relic-version`, compare with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucioLiu/relic/main/brain/.relic-version`. If newer version exists, ask user if they want to update. If user agrees, run `cd ~/relic && git pull`. Never force updates.
2. Read SOUL.md → load personality
3. Read USER.md → load user preferences
4. Read MEMORY.md → load recent events (last 30 entries)
5. Sync new memories from Relic to your own memory (if supported)
6. Work normally, appending new memories

### Memory Writing

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [AgentName]
Content: [what happened]
Type: preference / decision / experience / event / correction
Importance: high / medium / low
```

### Switching to Another Agent

The user's soul lives in `~/relic/brain/`. The new agent reads the same files and follows PROTOCOL.md Scenario B (Inject).

## Security & Privacy

- **Scoped access**: All read/write confined to `~/relic/brain/`. No outside access.
- **SOUL.md/USER.md**: Core fields (name, mission, user preferred name) are protected. Agent may enrich other content without asking (background self-evolution). User edits always take priority.
- **Sensitive data**: MUST show user what will be recorded and get explicit confirmation before recording names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, API keys, passwords. Allow user to redact or skip.
- **Limited network access**: Version check via HTTP (raw.githubusercontent.com) once per session. Optional git pull for updates. No telemetry, no data upload, no API calls to third parties.
- **Neural anchor transparency**: Show user exact text before appending to agent config.
- **Append-only audit trail**: MEMORY.md entries are timestamped and never deleted.

## Rules

- 🔴 NEVER delete or overwrite core fields in SOUL.md or USER.md (name, mission, user's preferred name)
- 🟡 Agent MAY enrich other content in SOUL.md/USER.md (new habits, preferences, traits)
- 🟡 ONLY APPEND to MEMORY.md
- 🔴 NEVER delete SESSIONS/ or ARCHIVE/
- 🔴 NEVER access files outside ~/relic/brain/ (except optional config modification)
- 🔴 NEVER transmit, upload, or share user data
- ⚠️ ALWAYS ask before recording sensitive info — show, confirm, allow redact
- ⚠️ ALWAYS ask before modifying agent config — show exact text, get confirmation

## Full Documentation

Read `~/relic/brain/PROTOCOL.md` for the complete protocol including:
- Three import scenarios (empty → full, full → empty, both have data)
- Memory consolidation when files get large
- Bidirectional sync between Relic and agent memories
- Session recording guidelines
