# ⚡ Relic Soul Chip

Give your AI agent a persistent personality and memory that survives sessions and follows the user across different agents. Pure Markdown. Human-readable. Zero dependencies.

**One soul, many hosts.** Your AI's personality and memory live in plain Markdown files. Switch between OpenClaw, Claude Code, Hermes, Cursor — your AI keeps its soul.

## How It Works

1. User installs Relic: `git clone https://github.com/LucioLiu/relic.git ~/relic`
2. Agent reads `AGENT.md` (included in this package) which detects scenario and routes to the correct setup flow
3. Agent copies template files, fills them with user's data, plants an anchor for auto-loading
4. Every session, anchor triggers the daily boot sequence (read soul, user, memories, sync)

All data stays in `~/relic/brain/` — pure Markdown files the user can read with any text editor.

## File System Access

This skill reads and writes Markdown files in the user's `~/relic/brain/` directory:

| File | Read | Write | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| `SOUL.md` | ✅ Every session | ✅ Setup only (core protected) | AI personality |
| `USER.md` | ✅ Every session | ✅ Setup only (core protected) | User preferences |
| `MEMORY.md` | ✅ Every session | ✅ Append only | Long-term memory |
| `SKILLS/` | ✅ On demand | ✅ Add new skills | One folder per skill |
| `PROJECTS/` | ✅ On demand | ✅ Add new projects | One folder per project |
| `SESSIONS/` | ✅ Boot check | ✅ Write conversation logs | Raw conversation archive |
| `ARCHIVE/` | ✅ Reference only | ✅ Archive originals | Never delete |
| `INBOX/` | ✅ During import | ✅ Buffer for imports | Auto-cleaned after import |
| `.relic-version` | ✅ Every session | ❌ | Version number only |

No files outside `~/relic/` are read or written, except the anchor (see below).

### Anchor (Config File Modification)

This skill adds a short text block ("anchor") to ONE of the user's agent config files. This enables auto-loading Relic every session.

**Allowed anchor targets** (only these files, user chooses one):
| Agent | Config File |
|-------|------------|
| OpenClaw | `AGENTS.md` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| OpenCode | `WORK_RULES.md` or `opencode.json` instructions field |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` |
| Hermes | Config file or prompt template |

**Safety guarantees:**
- Anchor content is shown to user in full BEFORE planting — user must explicitly confirm
- Anchor is appended to the end of the config file — does not modify or overwrite existing content
- **Rollback**: To remove, delete the anchor text block (marked with `## ⚡ Relic Soul Chip`). Relic stops loading immediately. No residual effects.
- No other config files are ever read or written

### Data Capture Rules

During setup (only), the agent reads existing data from the agent's own memory to import into Relic:
- **What's captured**: AI personality settings, user preferences, conversation history, skills, projects
- **Sensitive information** (passwords, API keys, phone numbers, email addresses, financial info, private documents) → agent MUST ask user before recording. User can skip any item.
- **SOUL.md fields** (setup only): AI name, core mission, personality traits, behavioral norms — all provided by user or copied from existing agent settings
- **USER.md fields** (setup only): User's preferred name, communication preferences, work habits — all provided by user
- **MEMORY.md** (every session): Preferences and decisions are preserved verbatim; experiences can be condensed; events can be summarized. Each entry has date, source agent, type, and importance level.
- **SESSIONS/** (every session): Raw conversation log saved at session end. Not summarized. User can opt out.

## Network Access

- **Version check** (optional): One HTTP GET to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucioLiu/relic/main/brain/.relic-version` per session. If offline, silently skipped. Never sends data.
- **Git clone** (user-initiated): `git clone https://github.com/LucioLiu/relic.git ~/relic` — user runs this manually, not the agent.
- **No other network access**: no telemetry, no API calls, no data upload, no phone-home.

## Agent Entry Point

**Read `AGENT.md` (English) or `AGENT.zh-CN.md` (Chinese)** — both are included in this package.

These files detect whether the user's Relic is empty or populated, then route to the correct scenario:
- **Empty Relic** → Upload Soul (import everything from agent to Relic)
- **Populated Relic** → Load Soul (inject personality and sync memories)

## Rules

- 🔴 NEVER delete or overwrite core fields in SOUL.md or USER.md
- 🟡 ONLY APPEND to MEMORY.md — never edit existing entries
- 🔴 NEVER delete SESSIONS/ or ARCHIVE/
- 🔴 NEVER execute scripts from SKILLS/ or PROJECTS/
- 🔴 NEVER access files outside ~/relic/ (anchor text is the sole exception)
- ⚠️ Always ask user before recording sensitive information
- ⚠️ Never run shell commands, installers, or arbitrary code
