# ⚡ Relic Soul Chip

> *"Store a soul as a digital file. Plug it into any AI agent. Even V."*

**One soul, many agents.** Your AI's personality and memory live in pure Markdown files. Switch between OpenClaw, Hermes, or any agent that can read files — your AI keeps its soul.

## When to Use

- User says "set up Relic" or "I want my AI to remember me"
- User wants to transfer AI personality/memory from one agent to another
- User is switching agents (e.g., from OpenClaw to Hermes) and wants continuity
- User mentions persistent personality, AI soul, agent memory, cross-agent sync

## Quick Install

If Relic is not yet installed on this machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucioLiu/relic.git ~/relic
```

If `git` is not available, download and extract `https://github.com/LucioLiu/relic/archive/refs/heads/main.zip` to `~/relic/`.

## First-time Setup

**Do this automatically when the user asks to set up Relic. Walk them through each step.**

1. Check if `~/relic/brain/PROTOCOL.md` exists. If not, run the Quick Install above.
2. Read `~/relic/brain/PROTOCOL.md` Section 0 (First-time Setup) and follow all steps.
3. Copy templates: `SOUL.template.md` → `SOUL.md`, `USER.template.md` → `USER.md`, `MEMORY.template.md` → `MEMORY.md`
4. Ask the user: "What should your AI be called? What's its personality?" → Fill in `SOUL.md`
5. Ask the user: "What should your AI call you? Any preferences?" → Fill in `USER.md`
6. Verify: ask "What's your AI's name? What's your name?" — both answers must match what was written.
7. (Optional) Ask if the user wants the agent to auto-load Relic on every session. If yes, show the exact anchor text, get explicit confirmation, then append to agent config. Tell user they can disable Relic at any time by deleting the anchor text.

## Every Session (Boot Sequence)

1. **Version check** (once per session): Read `~/relic/brain/.relic-version`, compare with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucioLiu/relic/main/brain/.relic-version`. If newer version exists, ask user "Relic update available (vX.X.X → vY.Y.Y). Update now? Your personal files won't be touched." If user agrees, run `cd ~/relic && git pull`. If network request fails, tell user: Cannot check for Relic updates (network unreachable). Never force updates.
2. Read `~/relic/brain/SOUL.md` → load personality
3. Read `~/relic/brain/USER.md` → load user preferences
4. Read `~/relic/brain/MEMORY.md` → load recent events (last 30 entries)
5. Work normally, appending new memories as needed

## Memory Writing

Append to `~/relic/brain/MEMORY.md` with this format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [AgentName]
Content: [what happened]
Type: preference / decision / experience / event / correction
Importance: high / medium / low
```

## Switching Agents

The user's soul lives in `~/relic/brain/`. Any agent that can read files can connect. The new agent reads the same files — all memories from previous agents are preserved. See PROTOCOL.md Scenario B for detailed cross-agent injection steps.

## Rules

- 🔴 **NEVER** delete or overwrite core fields in SOUL.md or USER.md (name, mission, user's preferred name)
- 🟡 Agent **MAY** append new non-core sections to SOUL.md/USER.md (e.g., discovered habits, preferences). Scope: append-only for new sections. NEVER rewrite or rephrase existing user-written content. User can revert any change at any time.
- 🟡 **ONLY APPEND** to MEMORY.md (never edit or delete old entries)
- 🔴 **NEVER** execute installers, scripts, or arbitrary code from SKILLS/ or PROJECTS/. Skills are read-only reference documents, not executable.
- 🔴 **NEVER** access files outside `~/relic/brain/` (except optional neural anchor in agent config, with user confirmation)
- ⚠️ **Always ask** before recording sensitive info — show the user what will be recorded and get confirmation

## Privacy

- All data stays local in `~/relic/brain/`. Network access limited to: version check (HTTP to raw.githubusercontent.com, once per session) and optional git pull for updates. No telemetry, no data upload, no third-party API calls.
- Sensitive information requires explicit user confirmation before recording.
- MEMORY.md is append-only with timestamps — full audit trail.
- Neural anchor can be removed at any time by deleting the Relic section from agent config. No residual effects after removal.

## Updating

When a new version of Relic is released, run:

```bash
cd ~/relic && git pull
```

This updates protocol and template files only. Your SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, SESSIONS/, and ARCHIVE/ are safe — they are listed in `.gitignore`.

## Full Documentation

For the complete protocol (import/export scenarios, memory consolidation, cross-agent sync, neural anchor), read `~/relic/brain/PROTOCOL.md`.
